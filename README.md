# Frontend for Full-stack tech assessment @WebMastry

Hey there !!


First things first, let's talk about our git workflow. We have a `main` branch, and a `dev` branch. Those are our main branches. The `dev` branch is always AHEAD or AT THE SAME LEVEL as the `main` branch. Never forget that!

When we want to work on a new feature (which is the case for you), we start by creating a branch (from the `dev` branch). We'd prefer if you call it something like `feature/your-feature-name`.

## Usage
Just start the app, and you're good to go. But don't forget to start the backend too.
